# FaultForge - Controlled chaos for bulletproof systems.
Break it before it breaks you - Chaos & stress testing platform for distributed systems.

FaultForge is a modern chaos engineering platform that helps you discover weaknesses in your distributed systems before they impact your users. Built entirely in Rust for performance and reliability, it orchestrates controlled failures and stress tests across your infrastructure.

## ✨ Key Features:
🎯 Master-Agent Architecture - Scalable orchestration across distributed environments
🔌 Plugin-Based Chaos - Extensible failure injection (CPU, memory, network, disk, custom)
📝 Declarative DSL - Define complex scenarios in simple YAML
🖥️ Multiple Interfaces - Web GUI, Terminal UI, and REST API
🔐 Enterprise Security - mTLS encryption and token-based authentication
📊 Rich Observability - Real-time metrics and comprehensive reporting
🐳 Cloud Native - Docker/Kubernetes ready with Helm charts

## 🌟 Use Cases:
- Pre-production Testing - Validate system resilience before deployment
- Game Days - Practice incident response with controlled failures
- Performance Baselines - Establish system limits and breaking points
- Continuous Chaos - Integrate chaos testing into your CI/CD pipeline
= Compliance Testing - Meet reliability requirements and SLAs
